Installing Octopi is a pretty straightforward task. 

Assuming you have updated Qt5 libs installed in your system, all
you have to do is run:

	makepkg -f

Wait for the compilation and then install the generated package (as 
root), using:

        pacman -U <nameOfTheGeneratedOctopiPackage.tar.[xz|zst]>

Octopi is located on the system utilities menu of your Desktop
Environment.


Enjoy!
